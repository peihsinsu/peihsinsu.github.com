===

We want free, we want simple, so __WikitPage__... This is not a creative, but a aggregate project. Hope you will like it!

This is a private wiki with pure javascript that design for users that want free wiki host. We thanks Github that provide the free Github Page service. Everyone who want to build a wiki, that can clone this project and follow the steps to build your own wiki. The wiki using GitHub md file markdown format to write your pages. You can just follow the GitHub format, and the page can show. (Almost the popular tag...)
